# Sweater Weather API


## About This Project
Sweater weather is a rails API backend framework that calls multiple API's to return weather forecast data for a location with an accompanying background picture. Sweater weather returns current, 8 hour, and 5 day forecasts. A user can register an account, obtain a 24-character unique API key, and create a road-trip. Using the API key users can create road-trips by providing origin and destination locations and are served the estimated travel time in addition to temperature and weather condition upon arrival. For more information check out the [Project Overview](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/sweater_weather/requirements).

## Learning Goals
* Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs.
* Expose an API that requires an authentication token.
* Expose an API for CRUD functionality.
* Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers.
* Research, select, and consume an API based on your needs as a developer.
